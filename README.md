## FAQ

### Why is Markdown better than a word processor?

Markdown is simple, clean, and perfect for the web; it is all that it needs to be and nothing more. Did I mention that it is free? Markdown's simplicity makes it easy for writers to write, collaborate, and use version control. In contrast, word processors filled with print-formatting tools distract from the hard work of writing and restrict authors to use proprietary software, file formats, and collaboration tools. 

### Why is my resume not showing up?
  
Your resume could be not showing for a couple reasons. Did you forget to push your index.md file or _config.yml file? If you just pushed your code, try waiting a little bit: GitHub pages can take up to 20 minutes to deploy. You can view the deployment progress by following the **github-pages** under the Environments section on your respository's main page.
